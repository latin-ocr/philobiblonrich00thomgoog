and Tanner the only bibliographers who mention this
date. The other extant copies bear the date 1599 and
appear to he a mere reissue with a fresh title-page. To
this reissue the editor prefixes a Latin Epistola Dedi·
caton‘a of four pages addressed to Thomas Bodley, in
which he compares him with De Bury lor his devotion
to literature and his benefaction to the University. He
explains how he had found his author “ in membranis
inter blattas et tineas semivivum, semiesum, pallentem
expirantemque‚” and how iar he was from being satis·
fied with his efforts to restore his author. He begs the
reader to condone the “ barbarisms and solecisms ” in
the Bishop's style and his slight lapses in matters of
saith and religion, both the saults of his age¹ He
concludes hy congratulating Bodley on the success of
his plans sor restoring the University library. The
letter is dated “ Ex Musaeo meo ln Colleglo Novo,
Julii 6. 1599”, and is signed “Thomas James''.

James was evidently under the impression that the
book had been only once printed It is not improbable
that he had before him the Paris edition. His title·
page at all events reproduces the title of that edititm
as horrowed from Trithemius ; though he uses the
phrase iu a fuller form and may of course have taken
it from Trithemius only. He reprints Bale's account
of De Bury, together with a MS. note of T[homas]
Asslen’s] in his copy oi Bale,² taken from Chambre’s
lile oi the Bishop, then still in manuscript.

¹ Dibdin speaks of this preface as “the veriest pieceoi old
maidenish particularity that ever was exhibitedl However,
the editor’s enthusiastic admiration of De Bury obtains his
forgiveness in the bosom oi every honest bibliomaniac.”

² This annotated Bale is now in the Bodleian. Heme
printed from it the note in question ln Leland's ltin, ix. 131.
