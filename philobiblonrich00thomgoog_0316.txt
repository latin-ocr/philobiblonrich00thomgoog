CHAPTER XV. 227

or will imitate Echo rebounding from the monn·
tains. For we know that the love of books is the
same thing as the love of wisd0m‚ as was proved in

92 the second chapter. Now this love is called by
the Greek word philosophy, the whole virtue oi
which no created intelligence can comprehend3 ior
she is believed to be the mother of all good things:
Wisdom‚ 7. She as a heavenly dew extinguishes
the heats of flesbly vices, the intense activity of
the mental forces relaxing the vigonr os the animal
forces, and slothfulness being wholly put to ssight,
which being gone all the bows of Cupid are un·
strung.

93 Hence Plato saysinthe Phaedo: The philosopher
is manifest in this, that he dissevers the soul from
communion with the body. Love, says Jerome,
the knowledge of the seriptnres and thou wilt not
love the vices of the flesh. The godlike Xeno·
crates showed this by the firmness ‘of his reason,
who was declared by the famous hetaera Phryne to
be a statue and not a man, when all her blandish-
ments could not shake his resolve, as Valerius
Maximus relates at length. Our own Origen
showed this also, who chose rather to be unsexed
by the mutilation of himself, than to be made
effeminate by the omnipotence of woman-though
it was a hasty remedy‚ repugnant alike to nature ²
and to virtue, whose place it is not to make men
insensible to passion, but to slay with the dagger
ol reason the passions that spring from instinct.
