xxx INTRODUCTION

os keepers by the scholares was but a natural exten-
sion to the case of books os the general system os
government in the Colleges os Oxford and Cam-
bridge.l The regulations of the Sorbonne‚ which
are only partly quoted by Cocheris‚ bave since been

. printed by M. Alfred Franklin,² and the rules pre·

scribed by De Bury will be found to be more minute
and complete than those os the Sorbonne. Among
other important variatione, De Bury does not direct
that any os his books are to be chained, which is a
main feature of the system of the Sorbonne.

The “special catalogue '' os his collection, which
De Bury tells us he had prepared, has unfortunately
not survived. No doubt from his own book andfrom
thebooks cited inthe works os his friends and house-
mates, who may reasonably be supposed to have
drawn largely from the Bishop's collections‚ it
would be possible to restore a hypothetical but not
improbable Bibliotheca Ricardi de Bury. The diffi-
culty would be with that contemporary literature,
which they would think below the dignity of quota·
tion, butwhich we know the Bishop collected. How
considerable the contemporary literature was in
point of quantity, we may learn from Le Clare, who
has registered no less than ten thousand productioris
for the fourteenth century.³
