printed collation profess to be absolutely complete.
ln an edition intended primarily for the general
reader‚ it seemed unnecessary to burden the notes
with a mass of various readings due to the errors of
copyists or to unsettled orthography. A complete
collation of the best MSS. and the important varia-
