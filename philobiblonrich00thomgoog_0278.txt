CHAPTER VI. ' 189

attract boys to religion, whom when they have
taken the vows ye do not instruct by sear and
force, as their age requires, but allow them to devote
themselves to begging expeditioris, and suffer them
to spend the time, in which they might be learning,
in procuring the favour of friends, to the annoyance
of their parents, the danger of the boys, and the
detriment of the order. And thus no doubt it
happens that those who were not compelled to
leam as unwilling boys, when they grow up pre·
sume to teach though utterly unworthy and un-
leamed, and asmall error in the beginning becomes
94 a very great one in the end. For there grows up
among your promiscuous flock of laitya pestilent
multitude of creatores, who nevertheless the more
shamelessly force themselves into the office of
preaching, the less they understand what they are
saying, to the contempt of the Divine word and
95 the injury of souls. In truth against the law ye
plough with an ox and an ass together, in com-
mitting the cultivation oi the lord’s field to learned
and unleamed Side by side, it is written, the
oxen were ploughing and the asses feeding beside
them: since it is the duty of the discreet to preach,
but os the simple to seed themselves in silence by
the hearing oi sacred eloquente. How many
stones ye fling upon the heap of Mercury nowa-
days! How many marriages ye procure for the
eunuchs of wisdom l How many blind watchmen
ye bid go round about the walls of the Church!
