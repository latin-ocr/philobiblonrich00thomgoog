however to 1483. Other bibliographers were no less at
fault : Fabricius¹ and Clement² know nothing ol the
Cologne impressiou; Peignot⁸ dates both editions
1473. Our own Dibdin believed that the supposed
Cologn'e edition was a myth 3⁴ and it was with surprise
as well as delight that he found it ‘ fall to his good lor·
tune’ in the Bibliotheca Spencerr'rma' “to describe the
present rare and inestimable impression,'' meaning this
very edition of Cologne. .

There has been a good deal of confusion as to the
Paris edition ol 1500 and a supposed reimpression of
James's edition at london in 1600. 1 will show
presently that there was in the former case only a
single impression, and that in the latter case there was
no impression in 1600, but that James's book was first
printed in 1598 and reissued the following year.
Again, none of the bibliographers has given a lull list
os the several impressione ol Goldast's text, and a
complete account os them here appears for the first
time. F mally, it has been asserted hy the Dictionary
(γ’ National Biograpliy that the edition now in the
reader’s hands was published “in 1885.”

I propose now to describe the various editions in
their chronological order :—

1473 The numo PRINCEPS ol the Philo-
Col⁰ti¹¹e biblon was printed at Cologne iu a small
quarto volume ol 48 leaves, without pagination‚ sig-
natures, or catchwords. lts printer is said to have
