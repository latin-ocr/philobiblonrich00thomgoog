’ BIOGRAPHICAL xv

note that during his stay at Avignon, he made the
acquaintance of Petrarch, who has lest upon record
a brief account of his intercourse with him, the
extent of which has been somewhat exaggerated
So far from a literary correspondence having been
established between them, Petrarch complains that
he could get no answer to his letters: “quamvis
saepe litteris interpellatus exspectationi meae non
aliter quam obstinato silentio satisfecit.”¹ He so
commended himself to the Pope, John XXII, that
he was made his principal chaplain; and, besides
other privileges, received a rochet in place of a
bull sor the next vacant bishopric in England.
His ecclesiastical preferments² were already so
numerous and valuable‚ that he was master of an
income of five thousand marks. The most con·
siderable of them was the Deanery of Wells, to
which he was appointed in 1333—“a goodly
preferment in those daies, better l think than the
Bishoprick is now,” as Bishop Godwin says.³ Nor
badhe long to wait sor the promised bishopric.

¹ Ep. Fam. iii. 1. De Sede, l. 165⁴), points out that
their friendship must have been formed during De Bury's
first visit, as Petrarch was absent from Avignon in 1333.

² See the long list of them in Tannen Bibl. Brit, 1748,
p. 573 which, however, may be supplemented from Browne
Willis, Cathedrals, ii. 437. Dr, Hook, Archblshops, iv.
82, gives a highly imaginative account of De Bury as a pre·
bendary of Chichester, but there is no evidence that he held
a stall there.
