which confirm rather than allay our doubts. We
have seen that De Bury actually died in debt, and
we know that his executore sold at least some

that de Chambre says nothing of alibrary at Oxford3

of the Philobiblon‚ we find that in the best MSS,
instead of naming the Hall to which his books are
to be presented, the Bishop leaves a capital letter
N in the text—which was the common fashion of
indicating a place left for the insertion of a proper
name. In the xviiith chapter he speaks of his
long nonrished design of founding a Hall, but so
