lxxiv INTRODUCTION

this letter, which ie dated 17 September‚·1484, it
appears that the Abbot, who was from 1456 to 1474
professor of theology at Vienna, had read tbe book
when a student there. He complains bitterly ol the
corrupted text of the Spires edition, which had
appeared the year before, and he had accordingly
carefully corrected it, and now sends his work to
Creussner to print. So far as we know, Creussner
did not print it. The Abbot’s letter was published
¹ by Jaeck in the Serapeum in 1843, Ed. iv. 191·2.

Basel In the University Library at Basel is a
(Ι) quarto paper MS. oi the fifteenth century

without the concluding note, and belongs to the
inferior group ol MSS. It is catalogued in Haenel, -
Catal. Libror. Mss, Lips. 1830, p. 527.

Venice In 1650 Tomasini recorded theexistence
’ (1) of a MS. in the library of S. Giovanni and
S. Paolo at Venice, belonging to the Dominicans,
adding : “ quern miror hic Gesnerum non observasse.” ¹
It was more fully catalogued in 1778 by Berardelli, the
librarian,² who as a good Dominican maintains that it
was written by Holkot. Since the collection has
passed into the Biblioteca Nazionale di S. Marco, it
hasbeen catalogued by Valentinelli,³ who assigned
it to the fourteenth century. The present librarian,
Signor Castellani, has been good enough to send me
