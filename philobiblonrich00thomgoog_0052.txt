BIOGRAPHICAL xliii

Durham, at whose request this treatise appears to

have been written at the end of the fifteeuth
century.¹

(118. Some reference must be made rothe
attempts to deprive De Bury of the authorship of
the th'lobiblon iu favour of Robert Holkot. This
claim, which has the support of Tanner, Hearne,
and Warton,² appears to have been first formally
put forward by Altamura and Echard, the biblio·
graphers of the Order of the Friars Preachers, who
rely upon the authority of Laurentius Pignon and
Lusitanus. These authorities are of course a cen-
tury later than the time of De Bury and Holkot3
aod if this were all, there would be no difficulty in
disposing of the claim. But in seven of the
extant MSS. of the Philobiblon the book is ascribed
to Holkot,³ as well as in a MS. once in the
possession of Fabricius,⁴ and perhaps in another
which was formerly in the Royal Library at
Erfnrt³ The Paris MS. has simply “Philobiblon
olchoti anglici,'' and it does not contain the con-
cluding note of which I have elsewhere spoken.

¹ See Herbert's Ames, i. 135·6. The book is “very
scarce,’' and there is no copy in the Britislr Museum. The
Bodleian has two copies, in one of which is a note by Douce.
