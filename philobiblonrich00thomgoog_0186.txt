quibusdelectibus proinde Clemens quintus occurrit,
si tamen praelati quae faciliter statuunt, fideliter

braeam quarn Graecam, nostris scholaribus pro

videre curavimus cum quibusdam adiunctis, quorum 5
adminiculo studiosi lectores in dictarum linguarum
scriptura, lectura necnon etiam intellectu, plurimum
poterunt informari, licet proprietatem idiomatis

r Clemens quintus] At the Council of Vienne in 1312, Ray·
moud Lully obtained srom the Council a decree ior the estab·
lishment os professorships of Greek, Hebrew, Arabic, and
Chaldee in Rome, Paris, Oxsord, Bologna, and Salamanca,
at the expense of the Pope aud the prelates: Rohrbacher,
Hist. Univ. de l'Eglise Cath, x. 356. Roger Bacon had
urged Clement IV. to cause Greek, Hebrew, and Arabio
to be taught in the Universities: see preface to the Op.
Majus, ed. 1750, xxxi.

grammaticam] These grammars bave unfortunately not
been preserved: it need not be assumed from the phrase
providere curavimus that De Bury wrote them himself. It
is more likely that he did not. But it is pretty obvious that
llallam has under·estimated his knowledge of Greeks
Lit. oi Europe, i. 73. The wanda were probably the
glossaries ol exotic words and technieal terms referred to in
ch. xii. s. 176.
