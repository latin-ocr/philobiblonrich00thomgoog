CHAPTER XV. 231

in bonds, and utterly deprived ol bodily liberty,
we use books as ambassadors to our friends, and
entrust them with the conduct of our cause, and
send them where to go ourselves would incur the
penalty of death By the aid os books we re·
member things that are past, aud even prophesy

as to the future ; and things present, which shift
and flow, we perpetuate by committing them to
writing.

03 The felicitous studiousness and the studious
felicity of the all-powerful eunuch, of whom we are
told in the Acts, who had been so mightily kindled
by the love os the prophetie writings, that he eeased
not from his reading by reason of his joumey, had
banished all thought of the populous palaee ol
Queen Candace, and had iorgotten even the
treasures of which he was the keeper‚ and bad
neglected alike his journey and the chariot in
which he rode. Love of his boolr alone had
wholly engrossed this domicile os chastity, under
whose guidanee he soon deserved to enter the gate ¹
of saith. O graeious love of books, which by
the grace of baptism transformed the child of
Gehenna and nursling of Tartarus into a Son oi
the Kingdoml

04 Let the feeble pen now cease from the tenor ol
an infinite taslr, lest it seem foelishly to undertake
what in the beginning it coufessed to be impossible
to any.
