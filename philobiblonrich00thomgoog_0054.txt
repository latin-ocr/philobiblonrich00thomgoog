be unfair to deprive De Bury of the credit of
having planned and written his own book ou such
shadowy evidence as can be adduced in favour of
Holkot's claim.l

It is the more satisfactory to think that we are

not called upon to deprive De Bury of the author-
ship of the Philobiblon, as, now that his books have
been dispersed, and his tomb despoiled, it is the
sole abiding memorial of one who loved books so
much in an age and country that loved them so
little. One who has sung his praises, in his own
words, “even to raving,’' has truly said of Richard
De Bury, that “his fame will never die.''² So, too,
the Philobiblon will ever continue to kindle the
love of those silent teachers who “instruct us with·
out rods and stripes, without taunts or anger, with-
out gifts or money 3 who are not asleep when we
approach them, and do not deny us when we ques-
tion them; who do not chide us if we err, or laugh
at us if we are ignorant.”³

Preachers, supports Holkot's claim in his recent work, Die
Universit'aten im Mittelalter, i. p. 7²7 note.
