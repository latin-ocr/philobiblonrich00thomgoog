CHAPTER IX, 211

from the cradle and hastily weaned, they mouth the
rules os Priscian and Donatus ; while still beardless
boys they gabble with childish stammering the
Categories and Peri Iiermeneias, in the writing of
which the great Aristotle is said to have dipped
55 his pen in his heart's blood. Passing through

these iaculties with baneful haste and a harmful
diploma, they lay violent hands upon Moses, and
sprinkling about their laces darlr waters and thick
clouds of the slries, they offer their heads‚ un-
honoured by the snows of age, lor the mitre ol
the pontificate. This pest is greatly encouraged,
and they are helped to attain this fantastic clericate
with such nimble steps, by Papal provisions ob-
taiued by insidious prayers, and also by the prayers,
which may not be rejected, of cardinals and great
rnen, by the cupidity os friends and relatives, who
building up Sion in blood, secure ecclesiastical
dignities for their nephews and pupils, before they
are seasoned by the course of nature or ripeness ot
learning.

56 Alasl by the same disease which we are de-
ploring, we see that the Palladium of Paris has
been carried off in these sad times os ours, wherein
the zeal of that noble university, whose rays once
shed light into every comer oi the world, has.
grown lukewarm, nay, is all but srozen. There
the pen ol every scribe is now at rest, generations
ol books no longer succeed each other, and there is
noue who begins to take place as a new author.
