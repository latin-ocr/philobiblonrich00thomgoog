1⁶8 m PHILOBIBLON

Wherefore books appear to be the most immediate
instruments of speculative delight, and therefore
Aristotle, the sun of philosophie truth in consider-
iug the principles of choice, teaches that in itself to
philosophiae is more desirable thau to be rich,
although in certain cases, as where for instance one
is in need of necessaries, it rnay be more desirable
’ to be rich than to philosophiae.

37 Moreover, since books are the aptestteachers‚ as
the previous chapter assumes, it is fitting to bestow
on thern the honour and the affection that we one
to our teachers. In sure, since all men naturally
desire to know, and since by means of books we
cau attain the knowledgeof the ancients which is to
be desired beyond all riches, what man living ac·
cording to nature would not feel the desire of books?

38 And although we know that suine trample pearls
under foot, the wise man will not therefore be de·
terred from gathering the pearls that lie before him.
A library of wisdom‚ then, is more precious than all
wealth, and all things that are desirable cannot be
compared to it Whoever therefore claims to be
zealous of nuth, of happiness, of wisdom ur know-
ledge, aye even of the faith, must needs become a
lover of books.
