office of the father may devolve, lest it suffer detri-

him above all the taslrs os bodily labour, adding:
“Happy effort,'' he says, “laudable industry, to
preach to men with the hand, to let loose tongues
with the fingers, silently to give salvation to mortals,
and to fight with pen and ink against the illicit wiles
ol the EvilOne.’' So lar Cassiodorus. Moreover,
our Saviour exercised the office ol the scribe
when He stooped down and with his finger wrote
on the ground (John viii), that no one, however
exalted, may think it unworthy os him to dowhat
he sees the wisdom os God the Father did.

handicralt pre-eminent above all other crasts that
are practised by the hand os man, to which our
Lord humbly inclines his breast, to which the
finger ol God is applied, performing the office os a
pen! We do not read os the Son os God that He
sowed or ploughed, wove or digged3 nor did any
other os the mechanic arts befit the divine wisdom
incarnate except to trace letters in writing, that
every gentleman and sciolist may know that fingers
are given by God tomen for the task of writing
