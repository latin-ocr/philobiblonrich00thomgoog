lxviii INTRODUCTION

words found in the Philobiblon3 of the 244 words
comprised in it, no less than 212 are used in this
boolr. li l had seen it earlier in my work, it might
have been of service in suggesting clues to the explana·
tion of some of the difficulties of the b00k; but as it
was, l had puzzled them out for myself before 1 saw
the glossary. lt only once or twice cites any authority,
and the explanations are seldom adequate and very
often incorrect. It includes asub, aux, and ellefuga;
inserts genzahar, but without explanation ; and makes
no mention ol Crato, Logostilios, comprehensor, invi-
sus, hereos,lilia, canonium‚ viola, hierophilosophus‚and
many other words which urgently call for explanation.

At Balliol College‚ 'there are two paper MSS. in
folio written in the fifteenth century: clxvi (A), and
cclxiii, the latter written in double columns, and with
the usual note at the end.

At Lincoln college, No. lxxxi (f. 79) is a folio MS. oi
the early fifteenth century in double columns, with illu·
minated initials. It has no preliminary note and
ends: “Explicit tractatus qui vocatur Philobiblon.'’
There can be no doubt that it was one oi the MSS.
chiefly used by James.

At Magdalen College‚ No. vi (f. 164) is a small quarto
MS. os the early fifteenth century. It has no title and
begins with Chapter 1., omitting the Prologue. At the
end is a note: “Explicit philibiblon diri Ricardi de
Aungervile cognoiati de Bury quondam Epi dimelrii
copletus anno d0¹ 1344i⁰ etatis nre 58. pont? nii
undec10.'' This also was one oi the MSS. upon
which James mainly relied.
