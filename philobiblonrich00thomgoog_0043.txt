It was long the fashion to speak of him with Sir
Henry Savile as the learnedest man os his age.
More recent critics have regarded him as not
a scholar himself, but a patron and encourager

reason to suppose that he was a sustained or
original thinker like Occam or Bradwardine3 nor

grammarian, who wrote a treatise Περὶ κτήσεως rai ἐκλογῆς
βιβλίων. The adjective φιλόβιβλος, of course, occurs in
Strabo, xiii. p, 608, who says os Apellihou, the purchaser
os Aristotle’s library, that he was φιλόβιβλος μᾶλλον ἢ
φιλόσοφος.
