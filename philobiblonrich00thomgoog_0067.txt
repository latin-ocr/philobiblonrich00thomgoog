lviii INTRODUCTION

deserved3 though Hearne's language is no doubt ex-
aggerated when he says oi him “in libello perpurgando
multum sudavit,”¹ there seems no reason to doubt that
he honestly looked into several MSS. At thesaure
time he leit a good deal to hedone ior the text oi his

p. 400 being a fresh title-page bearing the words “ ex
Bibliotheca et recensione Melchioris Haiminsseldii
Goldasti.’' From these words and from the “omnia
haec primum edita ’' the natural inserence would be
that Goldast thought he was printing the Philobiblon
lor the first time, or at least that he was printing it
from a MS. But the text with a few trifling variatione
