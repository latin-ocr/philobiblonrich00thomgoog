“Cod. sec. xv., II. J. 25. Inter alia iol. 157 incipit:

Missing It may be of interest to record such
manuscripts traces as 1 have met with of the existence
of other MSS, which may perhaps some day be found.
There was a MS. in the Bibliotheca A mploniana at
Erfurt‚ as appears by the catalogue published by
Dr. Schurn in 1887, p. 382. In a paper MS. (Q. 123),
described as oi the end ol the fourteenth century, the
twenty-fifth work was the Philobiblon. This MS. was
sent to London sor my use, but I round on examination
that the portion containing the Philobiblon had been re·
moved, as in fact appears from Dr. Schum's catalogue.
I cannot identify the MS. mentioned by Fabricius in
the Bibliotheca M. et Inf. Latinitatis¹ as being in his
’ possession with any extant MS. Cocheris² suggests
that it may be the Cottonian copy, but in the first
place this does not correspond to the description ol
Fabricius, and in the next place the MS. was in the
Cottonian Library in 1696 ³ and can never have been in
the possession of Fabricius.
