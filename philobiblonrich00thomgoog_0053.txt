xliv INTRODUCTION

In the other MSS, in which Ι have found the
work attributed to Holkot, the concluding note is
found, but they begin with some such words as
“Incipit prologus philobiblon Ricardi Dunelmens.
Epi que libmm compilauit Rohus Holcote de ordine
predicatorum sub nomine dicti episcopi.”¹ ln
the great majority of MSS. then, including the
earliest, this preliminary note is not found, and in
nearly all the MSS. where it does occur, it is ac-
companied by a final note, which is, to say the
least, hardly consistent with it.

As evidence, therefore, that Robert Holkot wrote
the Plrilobiblon it is not very satisfactory. In
order to gain such light as can be thrown upon the
matter from internal evidence, Ι have read through
most of Holkot's own writings, and Ι have 'no hesi·
tation in saying that so far as the evidence of style
goes, there appears little reason to assign the
Phr'lobr‘blon to Holkot. Lord Campbell has already
pointed out that the essentially autobiographical
character of the book is' all in favour of De Bury's
authorship. Holkot, who was one of De Bury's
chaplains, may indeed have acted as the Bishop's
amanuensis in the preparation of the book. A
traditionaland perhaps exaggerated account of this
may have reached the ears of some scribe or pos-
sessor of a MS. of the Plrt'lobiblon, and he may
have set down the note in question. But it would

¹ The Harl. MS. reads composuit for compilavit ; and the
final note is sometimes modified: see account of MSS„ post.
