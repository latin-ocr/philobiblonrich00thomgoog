lx INTRODUCTION

translation is a work of more spirit than accuraey‚ and
lnglis has too slavisbiy followed the edition of 1473,
under the mistaken idea that it was most likely to
represent the genuine text of the author. ln conse·
quence he unduly disparages the authority of James's

text. He has added “a few collations,” which are
however confined to printed editions, and thirty-seven
pages of notes, devoted largely to what Dibdin de-
scribes as “ unprovoked and unjustifiable abuse of the
English Church and her Ministers.''1 Probably only a
small edition was printed, as the work has become
searce, and Cocheris was unable to secure a copy.²

185⁶ The first edition of the book professing

Pan's to fumisb an adequate critical apparatus
and explanatory notes was issued in 1856 by M. Hip·
polyte Cocheris, then engaged in the Bibliothlqus
Mararine, of which he afterwards became Comama-
teur. The book formed part of a series called “Le
Tresor des pieces rates ou inedites‚'' and bears the
following title :

Philobiblion excellent traite sur l’amour des livres
par Richard de Bury, Evtque de Durham, Grand-
Chancelier d’Angleterre, traduit pour la premiere
fois en francais, precede d’une introduction et suivi
du texte latin revu sur les anciennes editions et

Hippolyte Cocheris. . . . Paris: Aubry‚ 1856.
