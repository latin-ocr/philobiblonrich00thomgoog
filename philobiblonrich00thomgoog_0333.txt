244 TIIE PHILOBIBLON

men choose to devote themselves to architecture,
others to agriculture, others to hunting, others to
navigation, others to was, others to games‚ we
have under the aspect of Mercury entertained a
blameless pleasure in books, which under the
rule of right reason, over which no stars are
dominant, we have ordered to the glory of the
Supreme Being‚ that where our minds found
tranquillity and peace, thenoe also might springs

²35 most devout service os God. And therefore let
our detractors cease, who are as blind men
judging of colours3 let not bats venture to spealr
os light3 and let not those'who carry bearns in
their own eyes presumo to pull the mote out ot
their brother’s eye. Let them cease to jeer with
satirica] taunts at things of which they are igno-
rant, and to discuss hidden things that are not
revealed to the eyes of men 3 who perchance
would have praised and commended us, if we
had spent our time in hunting, dice-playing, or
courting the smiles of ladies.
