Adam Murimuth's position as a canon of S.
Pauls's and a distinguished lawyer, who was several
times employed in diplomatic negociations, no
doubt gave him ample opportunities os collecting
trustworthy information as to the leading menos

engaged in similar lines os public employment, and
his view os the Bishop's character may have been
coloured by jealousyâ€š and bya sarcastic temper.

fact, and his account of De Bury's poverty agrees
only too well with several significant indications in
Chambre's lise, and in the Durham records: sub
