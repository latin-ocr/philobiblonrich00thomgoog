up with pleasure.''¹ ln 1850, Mr. W. S. Gibson, M.A.‚
of Lincoln’s Inn, read a “very elaborate” memoir oi
De Bury at the Oxlord meeting oi the Archaeological
institute 3² and in the Gentleman’s Magaaine for that
year it was announced that “ Mr. Gibson's memoir of
this Bishop is to be prefixed to a new translation of his
Plu'lobiblon which Mr. Gibson announces sor publi-
cation.''⁸ This work, however, had not appeared
when the British Archaeological Association met at
Durham in 1865, where Mr. Gibson read a paper on a

· “Seal ol Richard de Bury.’'⁴ But, despite the re·

newed promise, neither memoir nor translation has
ever appeared‚⁵ and it has remained for the present
editor at least to remove from our country thereproach
osso long leaving the taslr os preserving De Bury's
literary legacy exclusively in foreign hands.

⁵ A prospectus and syllabus of the proposed work is
appended to Mr. Gibson's Miscclhznies, issued in 1863. The
Philobiblon Society printed Mr. Gibson’s “Book-Huuting
under Edward 111„ a popular Lecture founded on the lile ol
Richard de Bury, Bishop of Durham, the first English Philo-
hiblist,'' with an Introductory Note by Lord Houghton:
Mucellanies,1865·6‚vol. ix. art. 3, pp. 78. The entry in
Hole's Brief Biogr. Dict, nv. Angarville‚ “Life by S.
Gibson,'' refers no doubt to the unpuhlished work. M. Syl·
vain Van de Weyer had promised a “ Notice sur Richard de
Bury'’ for the Philobiblon Society’s Miscellanies. The
promise was not redeemedr see his Choix d‘Opuscules‚ i.
