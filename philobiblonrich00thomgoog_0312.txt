CIIAPTER XIII. 2²3

ignorance of poetry we do not understand Jerome,
Augustine, Boethius, Lactantius, Sidonius, and very
many others, a catalogue of whom would more than
fill a long chapter.

34 Τὴε Venerable Bede has very clearly discussed
and detennined this doubtful point, as is related
by that great compilet Gratian, the repeater of
numerous authors, who is as confused in form as
he was eager in collecting matter for his compilation.
Now he writes in his 3yth section: Some read
secular literature for. pleasure, taking delight in the
inventions and elegant language of the poets3 but
others study this literature for the sake of scholar-
ship, that by their reading they may learn to detest
the errors of the Gentiles and may devoutly apply
what they find useful in them to the use of sacred
learning. Such men study secular literature in a
laudable manner. So far Bede.

85 Taking this salutary instruction to beart, let the
detractors of those who study the poets henceforth
hold their peace, and let not those who are igno·
rant of these things require that others should be
as ignorant as themselves, for this is the consolation
of the wretched. And therefore let every man see
that his own intentions are upright, and he may thus
make of any subject, observing the limitations of
virtue, a study acceptable to God. And if he have
found profit in poetry, as the great Virgil relates
that he had done in Ennius, he will not have done
amrss.
