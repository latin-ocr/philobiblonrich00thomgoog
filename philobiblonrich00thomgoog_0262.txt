ol stewarde that aman be found faithful Ye are
shepherds ol the Lord’s flock, as well in example
ol life as in the word os doctrine, which is bound
to repay you with milk and wool.

wisdom and intellect, ye ascend the teacher’s chair

51 and are called of men Rabbi By us γε become
marvellous in the eyes ol the laity, like great lights
in the world, and possess the dignities ol the
Chnrch according to your various stations. By
us, while ye still lack the first down upon your
cheeks‚ ye are established in your early years
and bear the tonsure on your heads, while the
dread sentence of the Church is heard: Touch not
minc anmhud and do my prophets no hom, and he
who has rashly touched them let him forthwith
by his own blow be smitten violently with the

52 wound of an anathema. At length yielding your
lives to wickedness‚ reaching the two paths ol

backward ye let gdtJre lot of God which ye had
first assumed, becoming companions of thieves.
And thus ever going from bad to worse, dyed with
thest and murder and manilold impurities‚ your
taine and conscience stained by sins, at the hidding
ol justice ye are confined in manacles and letters,
