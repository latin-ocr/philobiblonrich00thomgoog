PROLOGUE , 159

12 That our intent and purpose, therefore, may be
known to posterityas well as to our contemporaries,
and that we may lor ever stop the perverse tongues
ol gossipers as sar as we are concerned, we have
published a little treatise written in the lightest style
of the moderns ; sor it is ridiculous to find a slight
matter treated ol in a pompous style. And this
treatise (divided into twenty chayters) will clear the
love we have had for books from the charge of
excess, will expound the purpose ol our intense de·
Ἰνοῑὶοιι, and will narrate more clearly than light all

Ῑ3 the circumstances os ourundertaking. And because
it principally treats os the love of books, we have
chosen aster the fashion of the ancient Romans
fondly to name it by aGreek word, Philobiblon.
