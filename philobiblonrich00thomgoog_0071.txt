13⁶1 In 1861 one Samuel Hand published
Albany in the United States a volume, which
Allibone, “as an American, is glad to register ;” but
which, as a flagrant piece of book-making, is not very
creditahle either to its editor or to America Mr.
Hand reprinted the text oi Cocherisand the translation
oi lnglis,¹ reproducing all the errore and inaccuracies of
both He translated also the introduction and notes
of Cocheris, but his own few notes are worthless lt
is an octavo os pp. x. 252, of which 230 copies were
printed, 30 on large paper. I am glad to know that
Proi. Andrew F. West, of Princeton, contemplatos an
edition more worthy os the book and os America
The relation os the editions which have been now
enumerated may be thus exhibited 1

lt must be considered a surprising circumstance that
a book which has been so often printed abroad and so

to have acquitted himself “a son honneur et ὲ sa gloire de
cette tdche reconnuegeneralement comme tres difficile et que,
le premier, il avait ose entreprendre.’' Scheler, a more com·
petent critic, was evidently disappointed: Bull. duBibliophile
belgc, 1857, xiii. 142.

¹ Berjeau, and no doubt Inglis, resented this proceeding
and announced a new edition here: Notos and Quen'es,
4Ser. ii. 378 (17 Oct. 1868).
