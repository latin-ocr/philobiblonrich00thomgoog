. CHAPTER Χ.Δ · 215

Jerome, master ol three languages, Ambrosius,
Augustino, though he consesses that he hated
Greek, or even Gregory, who is said to have been
wholly ignorant of it, have contributed to the
doctrine of the Church, ir ruore learned Greece had .
not fumished thern from its stores As Rome,
watered by the streams of Greece, had earlier
brought forth philosophers in the image os the
Greeks, in like lashion afterwards it produced
doctors os the orthodox saith. The creeds we
chant are the sweat of Grecian brows, ‘pro-
mulgated by their Councils, and established by
the martyrdom ol many.

64 Yet their natural slowness, as it happens, turns
to the glory of the Latios, since as they were
less learned in their studies, so they were less per·
werse in their errors. In truth, the Arian heresy
had all but eclipsed the whole Church; the
Nestorian wickedness presumed to rave with
blasphemous rage against the Virgin, for it would
have robbed the Queen of Heaven, not in open
fight but in disputation, of her name and cha·
racter as Mother of God, unless the invincihle
champion Cyril, ready to do single battle, with
the help of the Council of Ephesus, had in ve-

⁶5 hemenee of spirit utterly extinguished it. Innu-
merable are the forms as well as the authors of
Greek heresies 3 sor as they were the original cul·
tivators os our holy saith, so too they were the first
sowers ol tates, as is shown by veracious history.
