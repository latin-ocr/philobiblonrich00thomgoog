158 THE PHILOBIBLON

easily melt a heart hard as an anvil into hot tears?
On the other hand, let us recall from past experience
howmuch it has profited the whole Christian com-
monwealth, not indeed to enervate students with
the delights of a sardanapalus or the riches of a
Croesus, but rather to support them in their poverty
with the frugal means that become the scholar.

10 How many have we seen with our eyes, how many
have we read of in books, who distinguished
by no pride of birth, and rej0icing in no rich in·
heritance‚ but supported only by the piety of the
good, have made their way to apostolic chairs, have
most worthily presided over faithful subjects, have
bent the necks of the proud and lofty to the eccle
siastical yolre and have extended further the liberties
of the Church?

11 Accordingly, having taken a survey of human
necessities in every direction, with a view to bestow
our charity upon thern, our compassionate inclina·
tionshave chosen to bear pious aid to this calamitous
class of men, in whom there is nevertheless such
hope of advantage to the Church, and to provide
[orthem not only in respect of things necessary to
their support, but much more in respect os the books
so usesul to their studies. T 0 this end, most accept·
able in the sight oi God, our attention has long been
unweariedlydevoted This ecstatic iove has carried
us away so powerfully, that we have resigned all
thoughts ol other earthly things, and have given
ourselves up to a passion for acquiring books.
