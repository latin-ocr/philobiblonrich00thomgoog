BIBLIOGRAPHICAL lxxi

1anoe Two MSS. have been lent me out ol
hands private custody. The first of them is a
very small quarto Flemish MS. os the not very early
fifteenth century. lt has no preliminary note, and
ends: “Explicit phylybyblon Richardi de Bury epi

what is so rarely met with-the actual MS. original of

a fifteenth century book But there can be no doubt
of the very close relationship. lt begins: “Incipit
prologus in librir de amore librort'i qui philobiblon
dicitur,” in red; but has no concluding note. lt be-

containing several treatises, oi which the Philobiblon
is the first. lt hasanote at the ioot of fol. 1¹: “ Iste
