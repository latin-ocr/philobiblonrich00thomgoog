lxxii INTRODUCTION

with the arms of Navarre] “ Victor. S Aug9tin⁹ ’' in
red letters ; and again at the foot of fol 4r this note :
“ Iste liber est sancti Victoris parisiensis. quicunque
eum furatus fuerit vel celaverit vel titulum isturn dele·
verit anathema sit amen. O.’' At the end of the Philo-
biblon is a note : “ Hunc librum acquisiuit monasterio
sancti victoris prope parisius frater Johannes ramasse
dum esset prior eiusdem ecclesie.” Lamasse was
, Prior from 1448 to 1458.l This MS„ which is in a
poor handwriting, begins: “Incipit prologus Philo·
biblon.”

ΤΙιε MS. numbered 3‚352 e is a well written folio
Ms„ which formerly belonged to Colbert‚ whose arms
are on its red morocco covers. Cocheris by an almost
incredible oversight has not noted that it bears at the
top of fol. 1r the words in red letters: “ Philobiblon
olchoti anglici.” lt begins nevertheless: “Incipit
prologus in philobihlon Ricardi dunelnensis episcopi,’'
and ends z “Explicit Philobihlon.''

Both these MSS, which I have called respectively
A and B, present a fairly good text. M. Leopold Delisle
is of opinion that they may have been written between
1375 and 1400, hut Mr. E. M. Thompson thinks that
they are not earlier than the beginning of the fifteenth
century.

The third Paris MS. is a folio MS. on paper
numbered 2‚454 of the Ancien Fonds latin. lt was
written pretty late in the fifteenth century and
presents a very inferior text.

The concluding note as to the date and authorship of
the book is not found in any of the Paris MSS.
