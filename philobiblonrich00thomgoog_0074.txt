lt has been already pointed out that the three
earliest editions ol the Philobr'blon appear to have

the Serapeum) a German bibliographical journal, a
very careful article on Richard de Bury, io which he
registered nineteen MSS. This article appears to
have dropped out of sight, and was evidently unknown
to Cocheris, whose list embraces only sixteen MSS,
including that of Fabricius and omits therefore four
MSS. recorded by Vogel

to the fifteenth century. The remaining three belong
