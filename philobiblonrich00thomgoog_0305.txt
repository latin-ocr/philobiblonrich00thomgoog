216 THE PHILOBIBLON

And thus they went on from bad to worse, because
in endeavouring to part the seamless vesture ol
the Lord‚ they totally destroyed primitive sim-
plicity of doctrine, and blinded by the darkness os
novelty would fall into the bottomless pit, unless
He provide for them iu his inscrutable prerogative,
whose wisdom is past reckoning.

166 Let this suffice3 sor here we reach the limit ol
our power of judgment. One thing, however, ve
conclude frorn the premises, that the ignorance of
the Greek tongue is now a great hindranoe to the
study of the Latin writers, since without it the
doctrines of the ancient authors, whether Christian
or Gentile, cannot be understood And we must
corne to a like judgment as to Arabio in numerous
astronomical treatises, and as to Hebrew as regards
the text of the Holy Bible‚ which deliciencies indeed
Clement V. provides for, is only the bishops would
faithfully observe what they so lightly decree.

Ι67 Wherefore we have taken care to provide a Greek
as well as a Hebrew grammar lor our scholars,
with certain other aids, by the help of which
studious readers may greatly inform themselves in
the writing, reading, and understanding of the said
tongues, although only the hearing of them can
teach correctness ol idiom.
