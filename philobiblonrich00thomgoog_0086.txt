BIBLIOGRAPHICAL lxxvii

J. F. Reimmann, the German bibliographer, had a
MS. in his possession, which he described in his Bib-
lzhtlreca Histor.-Lit., ed. sec, 1743, p. 147. He

declares it to contain a text very much superior to
any of the printed editions. He mentions also that
it was followed by a “carmen leoninum de re biblio-
thecaria,” which was not to be found in any of the
published texts. I do not know to what this refers;
it is certain, however, that the poem never formed any
part of the Plu'lobiblon.¹ ,

Tm most interesting, perhaps, of the missing MSS.
is that which Dr. Thomas Kay (or Caius) tells us be
saw and read at Durham College, Oxford, towards the
end of Henry Vlll.’s reign, and which he supposed to
be the copy given to the college by the Bishop him·
seis—‘⁶ eundem ipsum indubie, quem ipsemet biblio·
thecae illi vivus contulerat :” see Hearne's edos the
Assertio Antiquitatis Oxon. Academiae, ii. 433. “

His opponent in the controversy as to the respective
priority of the two universities, Dr. John Caius, boasts
of the possession of a MS. of the Philobiblon, which
he says was accompanied by a copy of the foundation·
deed of Durham College: loc. cit, i. 242·

&1¹³0ss the use I have made of the MSS. in
forming the text of the present edition. Of the whole
number of MSS. here enumerated l have personally
examined or collated twenty-ergit. I have not indeed
in the critical notes attempted to give a collation of
all these MSS. N or even of the four MSS. of which

couplets, which Lord Campbell quotes as De Bury’s, but
this is of course a mistake.
