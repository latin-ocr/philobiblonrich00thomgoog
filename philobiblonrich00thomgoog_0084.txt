BIBLIOGRAPHICAL lxxv

some account of the MS., which enables meto correct
that of valentinelli. He has also sent a tracing of the
handwriting,whichappearstobeofthefifteenthcentury.

The title appearing in the MS. must,1 think, have
been added aiter the edition of Paris r “ Philobiblon
seu de amore librorum ac de institutione bibliothe-
carum.'' TheMS. ends: “Explicit philobiblon magistri
Roberti Holkot1 ordinis Praedicatorum.''

Rome In May, 1885, M. Delisle‚ on returning

(Ξ) from Italy, was good enough to write to
me :—“ Le hazard m’a recomment fait passer sous les
y'eux le MS. 259 au fonds Ottoboni au Vatican. C’est
un volume copie au xiv⁰ siecle, dont la premiere partie
estle Philobiblon del'evdque de Durham.'’ Mr.W.Bliss
has kindly sent me an account of this MS., which he
assigns to the “end of the sourteenth century, or
later.” From a note upon it, it appears to have be-
longed to “Daniel Aurelius, 1564’' It does not give
the note at the end, and has no reference to Holkot.

Eseunal There is a MS. at the Escurial (Real
(1) Biblioteca de San Lorenzo), which was
catalogued by the late G. dee in the Bibliotheca
patrum lonicorum Hispaniensis, ed. by W. von Hartel,
Wien‚ 1887, p. 86 (cp. p. 537), who attributes the
volume of which it forms part to the iourteenth
century. According to Denifle, Die Unz‘versitdten
im Mittelalter, 1885, i. 797 n, the book is attributed
in this MS. to Holcot‚ but of this dee says nothing.
Father Felix Roranski‚ late librarian at the Escurial,

has, however, kindly sent me the following account oi
the MS. ε

¹ Not Kolkot, as Valentinelli has printed it.
