51 office of the Judge is to show mercy. And further

let our students be always diligent in invoking the
refuge of our hope after God, the Virgin Mother
of God and Blessed Queen of Heaven, that we
who for our manilold sins and wickednesses have
deserved the anger ol the Judge, by the aid of her

⁴ ever-acceptable supplications may merit his sor·
giveness ; that her pious hand may depress the
scale ol the balance in which our small and few
good deeds shall be weighed‚ lest the heaviness of
our sins preponderate and cast us down to the

52bott0m1ess pit ol perdition. Moreover, let them
ever venerate with due observance the most de·
serving Confessor cuthbert, the care ol whose flock
we have unworthiiy undertaken, ever devoutiy
praying that he may deign to excuse by his prayers
his all-unworthy yicar, and may procure him whom
he hath admitted as his successor upon earth to
be made his assessor in heaven. Finally, let them
pray God with holy prayers as well of body as of
souI, that He will restore the spirit created in the
image of the Trinity, aster its sojoum in this miser·
able world, to its primordial prototype, and grant ²⁰.
it lor ever to enjoy the sight of his counteuance:
through our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.
