xlvi INTRODUCTION

Poslscrz'pt.

Since this Introduction was in type, Mr. Ε.
Maunde Thompson has called my attention to a
remarkable account of De Bury in a passage of
Adam Murimuth, which has never yet been printed
and hasbeen overlooked by all the Bishop’s bio·
graphers. If it is to be accepted, it not only con·
firms the doubt I have suggested as to the establish-
ment of the contemplated Oxford library, but
supports the view that De Bury did not himself
write the Plu'lobiblon, and may indeed seriously
modify our estimate of his character. The passage,
as found in MS. Harl. 3836,f. 49¹, is as follows z·-

questu decimo nono, obiit Ricardus de Bury,
episcopus Dunolmensis, qui ipsum episcopatum et
omnia sua beneficia prius habita per preces mag·
natum et ambitionis vitium adquisivit, et ideo toto
tempore suo inopia laboravit et prodigus exstitit in
expensis, unde dies suos in gravissima paupertate
finivit. Imminente² vero termino vite sue, sui
familiares omnia bona sua mobilia rapuerunt, adeo
quod moriens unde corpus suum cooperire poterat
non habebat, nisi subtunicam³ unius garcionis in
