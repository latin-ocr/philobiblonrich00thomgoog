many by Melchior Goldast‚ apparently without any
knowledge of the English edition, in 1610, and reprinted
in 1614 and 1674 lt was also included in 1703 by
J. Α Schmidt in his supplement to the collection of
treatises on libraries published by J. J. Mader. There
is then no edition to record until the present century,
when an anonymous English translation was pub-
lished in 1832. In 1856 Cocheris issued the Latin text
with a French translation at Paris; and in 1861
Cocheris’ text and lnglis’s translation were reprinted
in the United States.

The bibliography of the Philobiblon long remained
uncertain and obscure, and indeed is hardly yet well
understood. Trithernius says os the book in his De
Smpton'bus Ecclesiastiat (begun in 1487 and printed
1494) “ iarn impressus est,” but there is nothing to show
whether he was acquainted with the Cologne or Spires
edition, or with both Leland, Bale, and Pits do not
mention a printed text The Paris printer must have
known that the book was in print, for he prefixes to his
edition the account of De Bury from Trithemius, but
carefully omits the statement that the book had been
already printed. When James came to print it, he
described his own impression as “ editio iam secunda,”
and Goldast intimates on his title-page that his issue
ol the book was a first impression. When the in-
cunabulists set to work to register the early produc·
tions oi the press, they ignored one or other of the
Cologne and Spires impressions, or, worse still, con-
founded them together. Thus Maittaire,¹ Panzer,² and
Denis⁸ mention only the Spires edition, and Hain ⁴ is
the first to record the two impressions, assigning both
