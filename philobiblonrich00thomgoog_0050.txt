ff ¹7· There seems no sufficient reason to sup
pose that De Bury wrote any other book than the
Philobr'blon. ’ Boston and Leland mention only this
book, but Bale² and Pits add avolume os Eptltolae
Familiares with another of Orationes ad Principes.
This list has been repeated by subsequent writers,
and even figures to this day in the Encyclopaedrir
Bn'tanm'ca.a Bale was not a very exact biblio·
grapher, and there seems to have been some con·
fusion, the source os which it is perhaps not diffi-
cult to indicate. Bale gives as the initial words oi
the Pln‘lobiblon: “Thesaurus desiderabilis ’' aud of
the Epistola: “ Ricardus miseratione divina.”
Now the former words arethe beginning of the first
chapter ol the Philobr'blon omitting the prologue,
and the latter words are at the beginning of this
prologue or introductory letter to the reader, so
that Bale has merely made the one work into two.
This suggestion derives support from the fact that
in at least one MS. the prologus is omitted and
the Plu'lobiblon begins with the Thesaurus desrilera-
bilis of Chapter 1.‘ This is perhapsamore probable
explanation than to suppose, as Dr. Creighton

¹Roy. 13 D. iv. 3.

² Bale, indeed, says: “ et alia scripsit ;'’ which is adopted
by Godwin, Cat. of Bishops, 1601, p. 524: “ he writ many
things not yet perished.’'
