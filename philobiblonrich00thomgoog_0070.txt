22 were on special papers and 2 on vellum]

The hook was dedicated to the late Prince Consort.

1 have elsewhere expressed au unfavourable judg·
ment of this edition,1 and a longer acquaintance with
it has only confirmed that judgment. Th'ough the text
professes on the title-page to be “reru” Cocheris has
in fact lest the text untouched and bas only given the
various readings os the three Paris manuscripts at the
foot of the page. This he justifies on the curious
ground that it was impossible to distinguish between
the faults of the author and those of the copyists‚
though that is most assuredly the first business of an
editor.² Unfortunately his report of the readings of
the manuscripts he has collated is quite untrustworthy
and in many instances even wildly wrong. But this is
not all: while professing to follow the text of the editio
pnhceps, what he has really done is to send to the
printer the text of 1703, with all the misprints, errors
of punctuation, and defects of all kinds which it had
accumulated in passing through the process of repro·
duction in 1500, 1610, and 1703. The result is that his
text is in many points less genuine and even less
correct than that os 1473. At the same time, Cocheris
cannot fairly be denied the praise of industry, and he
has brought together a great deal ol matter for the
illustration of his author, though he has done little or
nothing to clear up the more sormidable difficulties os
the text³
