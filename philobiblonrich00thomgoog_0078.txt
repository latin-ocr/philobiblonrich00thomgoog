BIBLIOGRAPHICAL lxix

At All Souls' College‚ No. mi (f. 236) is a large
quarto MS. ol the fifteenth century, written in double
columns, It begins : “Incipit prologus in philobiblon
Ricardi dunolmensis episcopi.’' At the end is the
usual note with some variations: “Explicit tractatus
qui dicitur Philobiblon id est amor librorum editus
a Drio Ricardi de Buri quondam Dunolffi epo com-
pletus est autem in manerio nostro de Ackeland in
festo conversionis sancti Pauli A⁰. dni m¹ cccmo xhijj0.
etatis nostre 1νίἱίο pont vero nri Anno xi⁰. finiente ad
laudem dei feliciter et Amen.’'

At Corpus Christi College‚ No. ccxxii (f. 57) is a
small quarto MS. ol the fifteenth century. It begins :
“ Incipit prologus in Philobiblon Rici Dunelmenssis epi
que librum compilanit RoBus holcote de ordine pre-
dicatou'sub nomine dicti Episcopi ”5 and ends with
the usual note.

In Mr. Coxe's catalogue ol the Corpus MSS„ he ob-
serves under no. clxvii (p. 68) that ‚this MS, which
contained the Philobiblon, has long been missing.
Itis, Ithink‚ apparent on comparing the entries in
Bemard under nos. 167 and 222 that two volumes
have been bound together, and that nothing is really
“missing ; ’' and the entry in Coxe's catalogue should
be corrected accordingly.

At S. John’s College‚ No. cbrxii (f. 2) isan early
fifteenth century quarto MS. with an illuminated
initial After the title th'lobiblon follow the words
in red: ‘⁴ Hic aurum tibi non valet vbi nitet Philo·
biblon.” At the end is the usual note. The MS.
bears a note to the effect that it was presented to the
college in 1634 By an oversight, though dnly cata-
logued by Mr. Coxe, it is not included in his index.
