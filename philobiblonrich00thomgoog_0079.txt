At Corpus Christi, College, among Archbishop
Parker's books is a quarto MS„ on f. 127 of which
is the Philobiblon, written in the fifteenth century.
There is no preliminary note, ,and the concluding note
is very inaccurately given. It is catalogued by
Nasmith, Catal librorum MS.orum, 1777, at p. 416.

At Sidney Sussex College, isa MS. partly on paren--
ment und partly on paper, poorly written in the
fifteenth century ;'' which was presented to the college
by William Pratt, Vicar of Bossel, Yorkshire. lt has
the concluding note. ’

Durham In Bishop Cosin’s Library at Durham
(1) is a fifteenth century octavo Ms, which
found its way into the Bishop's collection through the
Rev. George Davenport, its first Keeper, who pre-
sented seventy MSS. to the library. An account of
Davenport is in Snrtees’ Hist. of Durh, i. 153, 170.
The MS. is catalogned in Rud's catalogue, at p. 177
of Botfield's Durham Catalogues. Though very neatly
written, the MS. presents numerous omissions of single
words. It is without preliminary note and ends:
“Explicit philobiblon Drii Ricn Almgeruile cognoiati
de Buri quod epi Dunelrnenb.
lt may be noted that the Philobiblon is not found in
any of the earlier catalogues of Durham books printed
by the Snrtees Society.
