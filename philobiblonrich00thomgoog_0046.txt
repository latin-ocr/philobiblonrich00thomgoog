tural quotation and allusion 3 like that of many
among the mediaeval writers, itis “made os the
Scriptures.”¹ Though he affects to write “in the
lightest style of the moderns‚'' he has none os
the ease and fluency os such writers as John of
Salisbury, and his rhetoric, genuine as no doubt it
is, is too often clumsy and overlaboured. Although
his book can scarcely claim to rankas a masterpiece
of literature, the text now printed will show that
his style is much more correct than has been
hitherto supposed.

The special interest to us os Richard De Bury
is that he is, il not the prototype, at least the
most conspicuous example of a class of men who
have been more numerous in modern than in
ancient or mediaeval times. No man has ever
mnied to a higher pitch of enthusiasm the passion
for collecting books. On this point, at least, De
Bury and Petrarch were truly lrindred spirits, and
their community os feeling finds expression in a
striking similarity os language. The letter in which
Petrarch seeks the co·0peration ol his brother
Gerard presents close resemblance to a well-known
passage in the Pln'lobiblon. Petrarch writes²2
