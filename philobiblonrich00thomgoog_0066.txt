Fabricius² says that the text of James was again
printed at London in the following year in the Ecloga
Oxom'o-Cantabrzgiensis; but this statement appears
to rest upon a misunderstanding. The Ecloga isan
account oi the MSS. at Oxiord and Cambridge, and
wasto have been published, as James tells us, with the
Philobiblon. As it was n9t finisbed and the printer
grew impatient, James decided not to wait sor it, but
instead gave the appendix which is affixed to the
Plzz’lobz'blon‚ and which is merely an index oi authors
represented in the Oxiord MSS. But the Philobiblon
was not reprinted with the Ecloga issued in 1600, as
Fabricius must have supposed²

The Ecloga enables us to say what MSS. James bad

enumerated in the Ecloga³ are: At Oxlord four, viz,
atAll Souls', Lincoln, Magdalen,and Balliol; at Cam·
bridge, at Benet's (now C. C. C.), audone in Lord
Lumley'slibrary. 'ibe five college MSS. are still where
they were; Lord Lumley‘s should have passed into the
Royal Libram, and maybe one oi the MSS. now in the
British Museum. There can be little doubt that James
relied largely upon the Magdalen and Lincoln MSS.⁴

containing “nothing more than the Cologne impres·
sion, being sometimes, indeed, less particular,''⁵ and
Inghs, who “doubts his having looked into several
MSS, but has no doubt of his having preferred his
own words to those oi the author.”⁸ This is not
