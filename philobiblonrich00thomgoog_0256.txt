33 preferred. Moreover, since we know that riches
first and chiefly appertain to the support ol the
body only, while the virtue of books is the perfec·
tion of reason, whichis properly speaking the hap-
piness of man, it appears that books to the man
who uses his reason are dearer than riches.
Furthermore, that by which the saith is more
easily defended, more widely spread, more clearly
preacbed, ought to be more desirable to the faith-

34 ful. But this is the truth written in bookS, which
our Saviour plainly showed, when he was about
to contend stoutly against the Tempter, girding him-
self with the shield of truth and indeed of written
truth, declaring ‘⁴ it is written ’' of what he was about
to utter with his voice.

35 And, again, no one doubts that happiness is
to be preferred to riches. But happiness con-
sists in the operation of the noblest and diviner
ol the faculties that we possess-when the whole
mind is occupied in contemplating the truth
of wisdom, which is the most delectable of all
our virtuous activities, as the prince of philoso
phers declares in the tenth book of the Ethics,
on which account it is that philosophy is held to
have wondrous pleasures in respect of purity and

36 solidity, as he goes on to say. But the contempla·
tion of truth is never more perfect than in books,
where the act of imagination perpetuated by books
does not suffer the operation of the intellect upon
the truths that it has seen to suffer interruption.
