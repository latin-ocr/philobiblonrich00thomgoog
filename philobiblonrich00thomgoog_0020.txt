Introduction

Biographical

(I 1. Though the account given of himself by
Richard De Bury in the Philobiblon is far from
satissying our curiosity, it must be reckoned a
fortunate circumstance that he has toldus so much
as he has of his career and of his pnrsuits. Apart
from the autobiographical particulars which he has
there set down, we should have had but scanty
materials from which to present his portrait. The
chief authority for his lise is William de Chambre‚²
one of the Durham historians, whose sketch, how·
ever, is so slight that, although he tells usos the
Bishop's great affection for books, and his wonder-
ful collection of them, he says nothing of his
proiect of founding a library at Oxford, and makes
no mention of the Philobiblon.

(I 2. Richard De Bury was born on the 24th os
January‚ 1287, in a little hamlet near Bury st.
Edmund's‚ in Suffolk, which was lamed sor its

² Chambre's life, first printed in Wharton’s Angla'a Sacra,
is more accurately printed in the Surtees Society edition oi the
Scriptores Tres. Little is known of Chambre‚ who appears,
however, to have been an officer of the Convent os Durham.
