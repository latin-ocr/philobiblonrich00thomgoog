I.-·-Printed Editions.

Wemay inferirom the corruption ol themany existing
MSS. that the Philobr'blon was frequently copied, and
from their distribution that it soon found its way into
the libraries not only oi our own country, but oi France,
Germany, the Low CountrieS, Italy, and Spain. In
1358 long extracts from it are found embodied in a
University statute at Oxsord,¹ yet, as has been already
stated, the Bishop's biographer Chambre makes no
mention olbis book3 and the earliest references to it
that 1 have found are in Boston († 1410) in this country,
and in Trithemius († 1516), the famous Abbot ol Spon-
heim‚ on the Continent. It has been suggested that
Thomas a Kempis made use oi the Plrilobiblon in
his Doctrinale Iuvenum, but Ι have shown elsewhere
that the suggestion is uniounded.²

The book appears· to have lound a wider audience
abroad than at home, and it was three times printed
on the Continent-at Cologne in 1473, at Spires in 1483,
and at Paris in 15oo-and then had to wait for another
century before it found an English printer. The
edition of Thomas James, Bodley's first librarian,
appeared in 1598-9. lt was then again printed in Ger·

printed by Anstey‚ Munim. Acad„ i. 207-8, who has not
noticed the quotation. It may be a quotation in De Bury.
